# Azure Challange - App Modernization with Azure Functions

Contoso Coffee Ltd., a popular supplier of goods for baristas has decided that it's time to move their 15 years old e-commerce application to the cloud. Nonetheless, their CTO, John Wash, wants to leverage their cloud migration as an opportunity to modernize their core business logic backend as well. Specifically, they've looked at how they could take advantage of Azure Functions to achieve a higher degree scalability whenever their application is under high load.

That said, whilst technically they could certainly implement the greatest and latest services to achieve the craziest of scalabilities, their current customer portfolio and market share doesn't validate the use of many specific and expensive services. Sure enough, they are looking to minimize their operational Azure costs doing the same.
